-a foreign key refrences the id of another entity in the database

-can not have an array of data in a datasheet

-on a datasheet a single cell can not have multiple things

-instead of having multiple data entries in a datasheet cell, it is better to have another datasheet.

-there is more query power in having multiple data entries in a sinlge cell but the trade off is that it becomes hard to understand if there are multiple data sheets

-early engineers put a heavy enphasis on performance, however a performance bottleneck with SQL will not be reached unless there is already a lot of money being made.

-although not really since SQL is that good

-relational SQL databases are the bread and butter for noobs and it is industry standard
